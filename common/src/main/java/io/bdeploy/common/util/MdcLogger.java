/**
 * Utility class that simplifies writing log statements with MDC data.
 * <p>
 * The logger is typically {@link #setMdcValue initialized} with a fixed MDC value that is attached to all log calls.
 * If required {@link #log(Consumer, Object...) additional} data can be passed to each log call.
 * </p>
 * <b>Typical usage pattern:</b>
 *
 * <pre>
 *  public class MyClass {
 *      <span style="color:green">private final MdcLogger logger = new MdcLogger(MyClass.class);</span>
 *
 *      public MyClass() {
 *          <span style="color:green">logger.setMdc("green");</span>
 *      }
 *
 *      public void foo() {
 *          <span style="color:green">logger.log((l) -> l.info("Doing some work."));</span>
 *
 *          <span style="color:green">logger.log((l) -> l.info("Doing more work."),"red");</span>
 *      }
 *  }
 *
 *  The following output will be printed when a pattern layout is used:
 *       %-12.12MDC{BDEPLOY} | %-5level | %-20msg - (%F)%n
 *
 *       green       | INFO | Doing some work.  - (MyClass.java)
 *       green / red | INFO | Doing more work.  - (MyClass.java)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The actual log call is delegated to a functional interface so that the line numbers and the class is preserved in the log
 * statements. As consequence it is also up the the caller to check if the desired log level is enabled.
 * </p>
