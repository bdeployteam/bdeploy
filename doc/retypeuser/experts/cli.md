# Command Line Interface

**BDeploy** provides a rich CLI which allows automation of most interactions with **BDeploy**, e.g. for use in build pipelines, etc.

The same binaries used to run a **BDeploy** server provide a set of _commands_ along with available _options_. This chapter describes the available _commands_. The _options_ are well-described when calling the according _command_ with the `--help` _option_.

## Common Options

| Option       | Description                                                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-q`         | Quiet - no progress reporting on long running operations.                                |
| `-v`         | Verbose - some tools may include additional information.                                 |
| `-vv`        | Very verbose - enable progress reporting for every tool, show timing summary at the end. |
| `-o <FILE>`  | Redirect output to the given `FILE`.                                                     |
| `-op <FILE>` | Redirect progress reporting output to the given `FILE`.                                  |
| `--csv`      | Output any data in CSV format.                                                           |
| `--json`     | Output any data in JSON format.                                                          |

### Initialization and local Configuration Management Commands

| Command       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `certificate` | Manage the server certificates (export the existing, import a new, set a separate HTTPS certificate). This is mainly used to import a properly signed certificate to the _master_, which serves the Web UI using this certificate over HTTPS. **BDeploy** itself does not require a properly signed certificate for internal operation to guarantee [security](/experts/security/#security).                                                                   |
| `cleanup`     | Manage the schedule at which the _master_ performs background cleanup operations on all _nodes_ (including the master itself).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `config`      | Allows changes to the basic configuration like hostname, port or mode. The `init` command stores the given hostname, used later on for connections to self and also for variable expansion. If the hostname changed or is no longer valid, this tool can update it. Please refer to [Migrating between Modes](/user/central/#migrating-between-modes) in case you need to change the minion mode. Allows modification of the log root via `--logData=\<path\>` |
| `init`        | Initializes a _root_ directory for running a server with the `start` command. The init command can be instructed to initialize the directory to run a **master** or a headless **node** when running the `start` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `ldap`        | Manages LDAP synchronization job schedule and settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `pool`        | Manages object pooling related settings and the re-organization job schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `storage`     | Manages available _storage locations_. A _storage location_ is a folder where the **BDeploy** _master_ puts the **BHives** required to store data for **Instance Groups** and **Software Repositories**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Local Session and Scripting Commands

| Command | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `login` | Manages local login sessions to remote servers. This command eliminates the need to manage URIs and tokens yourself. Login sessions are managed per user, can be created, switched, and removed. Validity of the login session is the same as for the Web UI. Subsequent commands will use the configured remote login session to perform remote communication.<br/><br/>:warning:**WARNING** Since login sessions are persistent, it can be easy to confuse which session/server is currently worked with. Always verify that the correct session is actively used by commands when performing modifications on the server, e.g. deleting an **Instance**. |
| `shell` | Provides an interactive shell which can execute tools. The shell can also be fed with a script file which contains a series of commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Product Management Commands

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `product` | List or create **Products** locally. Fetches required dependencies from the given remote **BDeploy** server. Has the ability to push the resulting **Product** to the target **BDeploy** server. |

### Remote Server Management Commands

| Command                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `remote-data-files`         | Remotely manage data files for a given instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `remote-deployment`         | Manage **Instance** deployment (_install_, _activate_, _uninstall_, _updateTo_ (product version)) on a remote **BDeploy** server.<br/><br/>:information_source:**NOTE** The `--updateTo` command will only work if the new product version can be updated to without manual changes. If for example a mandatory parameter is added, or a configured application is removed from the product, the update will fail. |
| `remote-group`              | Manage **Instance Groups** on a remote **BDeploy** server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `remote-instance`           | Query and manage **Instances** on the remote **BDeploy** server.

| `start` | Runs the **BDeploy** _minion_ in the mode determined by the given root directory. Requires a root directory initialized with the `init` command.<br/><br/>:information*source:**NOTE** A \_master* is always a _node_ as well. The _master_ just has the additional capability to control other _nodes_, and provides the configuration Web UI. |

### Utility Commands

## BHive CLI

**BHive** is the underlying storage used by **BDeploy**. **BDeploy** serves **BHives** for all minions (_master_ and _node_), and has additional **BHives** per **Instance Group** and **Software Repository** on the _master_.

**BHive** itself does not know about **BDeploy**, it is 'just' a dumb storage backend which is responsible for de-duplicated, distributed, fail-tolerant (failure-recoverable) storage of file contents.

Much like Git, **BHive** only knows two commands that actually perform remote communication: `fetch` and `push`. All other commands are performing their work locally.

| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `du`       | Calulate disc usage for given manifest(s) in a **BHive**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `fsck`     | Performs a file system check (_fsck_). This involves resolving all inter-**Manifest** dependencies, as well as re-hashing all objects in the underlying storage to assert that all objects in the storage are valid. <br/><br/>Also allows to fix found errors (by deletion). After this, missing **Manifests** must be re-pushed from a **BHive** which still has the required objects. |
| `init`     | Initalizes a new, empty **BHive** in a given directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Launcher CLI

| Command       | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `browser`     | Opens the BDeploy browser UI.                                                                                                                                 |
| `launcher`    | Reads a given `.bdeploy` file, which describes all required information for the launcher to contact a **BDeploy** server and download a _client_ application. |
| `uninstaller` | Uninstalls a given application and cleans up in the local storage.                                                                                            |

Note that the Launcher CLI has special logic unlike all other CLIs. The special rules are as follows:

* If the tool-specifying argument is missing altogether "browser" is automatically assumed.
    * This rule does *not* apply if the argument "--help" is specified.
* The tool-specifying argument may be replaced with a path to an existing .bdeploy file. In this case, the "launcher" tool will be assumed, and the given path will be given as an argument to the launcher tool.

## Environment Variables

**BDeploy** and **BHive** CLIs provide a set of environment variables that allow you to provide environment defaults for certain command line arguments.

Each command will include information for the according environment fallback in it's help output, for instance:

```
$ bdeploy bhive init --help
