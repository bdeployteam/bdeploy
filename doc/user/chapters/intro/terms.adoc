=== Terms

BDeploy has a some important terms and concepts which should be known before diving into details of the application itself. These terms will be used all over the documentation to cross-reference other parts of the application.

|Term
|Meaning
| *Instance Group*
| An *Instance Group* is the main top-level element used in *BDeploy*. It provides a grouping of *Instances* (as the name suggests).

| *Product*
| A piece of software that can be deployed with *BDeploy*. A product is a bundle of *Applications* along with some meta-information.

| *Application*
| A part of a *Product* that can be started and stopped separately. Applications either run as *Process* on a server machine or as *Client Application* on a desktop computer. 

| *Client Application*
| An *Application* that can be distributed on desktop computers.

| *Instance*
| An *Instance* is the actual deployment configuration of a *Product*. In one instance, the *Applications* of a *Product* can be distributed as *Processes* on one or more *Nodes*.

The *Product* (and it's *Applications*) describes the _possible_ configuration values (e.g. configuration files, command line parameters, etc.) - the *Instance* provides _actual_ values for these.

| *Instance Version*
| An *Instance Version* describes the configuration state of an *Instance* at a given time. Each change that is done by the user results in a new instance version. Versions are immutable and cannot be changed. Each new change results in a new version of an *Instance*.

| *Process*
| A server *Application* that is configured to be started on one of the server *Nodes* of an *Instance*.

| *Build*
| A *Build* represents the immutable collection of all runtime artifacts   (binary files, configuration files, templates etc.) of a *Product*. As a *Build* is immutable, the build tool (Maven, Gradle, Eclipse) creates a new one on every execution.

| *Product Version*
| A *Product Version* represents a *Build* that is marked with a *Tag*.

| *Tag*
| A *Tag* identifies a *Product Version*. The structure of a tag is defined by the *Product* itself. The only obligation is, that a tag has to be unique for different *Builds* of the same *Product*.

| *Node*
| A server machine (virtual machine or bare metal) that is used in an *Instance* to run the configured *Processes* on it. *BDeploy* supports Windows and Linux nodes, even mixed in one instance.

| *Minion*
| Agent process provided by *BDeploy* that has to run on every *physical node* used by BDeploy. In a multi-node setup one minion takes the role of a master. All others act as headless nodes which are managed by the master.

| *Deployment*
| The whole process of making one *Instance Version* up and running. This includes the major process steps: *Installation*, *Activation*, *Process Control*.

| *Installation*
| The process of transferring the configured *Processes* of an *Instance Version* to all *Nodes* of that *Instance*. The *Installation* makes this *Instance Version* available for its *Activation*.

| *Activation*
| The *Activation* marks a previously *Installed* *Instance Version* as the one to be started by the *Process Control*. Only one instance version can be active for one instance at the same time.

| *Process Control*
| The *Process Control* is responsible for starting, keep-alive and stopping the *Processes* of the active *Instance Version*.
