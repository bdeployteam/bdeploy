=== Instance Group

An *Instance Group* acts as logical container for *Instances*. It typically contains several *Instances* for different purposes (productive, test, development). Adding them to the same group provides a better overview which of them are belonging together. An empty page is displayed if no instance group has been created.

Use the btn:[+] button in the toolbar to create a new *Instance Group*.

[NOTE]
The name of an instance group cannot be changed, and is used internally as a name in the file system on the server. Be careful when choosing the name.

The _Automatic Cleanup_ option helps to reduce the amount of consumed hard disk space. During the lifetime of an *Instance Group*, probably many new versions of a *Product* are deployed. To avoid that the hard disk is filled up with *product versions* that are not used anymore, there is an option to activate an automatic cleanup job. If the option _Automatic Cleanup_ is enabled, old *product versions* that are no longer in use by *Instances* of this *Instance Group* are deleted automatically. To avoid that a *Product* vanishes completely, the very latest *product version* always remains.

==== Instance Group Dialog

All *Instance Groups* that are visible to the user (as per the assigned permissions) are shown in the *Instance Groups* dialog.

==== Instance Group Access

A new *Instance Group* is initially only visible to users with global read permission (or higher). You can assign permissions to users either globally, or per *Instance Group*. To assign local permissions, click the *Instance Group* to get to its *instance overview* and then click the btn:[Group Settings] toolbar button. The Group Settings panel is shown.

Click the btn:[Instance Group Permissions] button to navigate to the permission panel.

To assign a local permission to a given user, click the btn:[Modify] button in the according table row. A dialog will pop up asking for the permission to assign. Choose an apropriate one and click btn:[OK].

The local permission will be shown next to the global permission. The highest available permission level is taken into account for any permission checks.

The user table is grouped by permission assignment, either global, local or unassigned.

==== Initial Steps

Click on an *Instance Group* to open the *instance browser* of this group. Here you can see all *Instances* grouped by their _purpose_ (can be `Development`, `Test` or `Productive`).

Since an *Instance* requires a *Product*, an empty *Instance Group* will initially display a shortcut to the <<Manage Products,products>> page. If there is at least one *Product* available already, the shortcut changes to the help you to <<Create New Instances,create a new instance>>.

==== Manage Products

*Products* can be obtained by <<_building_a_product,building a *Product*>> or by downloading an existing version from another *Instance Group* on the same or another *BDeploy* server, using the btn:[Download] button on the *Product* details panel.

[NOTE]
On the BDeploy Releases page you will find some sample products to experiment with for each release, see https://github.com/bdeployteam/bdeploy/releases

On the *Products* page, click the btn:[Upload Product] button to upload new *Products*.

Click browse and choose a *Product* _ZIP_ file to upload, or simply drop on on the highlighted drop zone. The *Product* will be uploaded immediately.

Once a *Product* is available, you can click it to open the *Product* details panel. This panel allows you to btn:[Download] a *Product* version as _ZIP_, or btn:[Delete] individual versions of the *Product* as long as it is not currently in use by an *Instance* version. There rest of the panel provides additional information about the *Product*.

==== Create New Instances

To create a new *Instance*, click the btn:[+] button at the bottom of the page. After giving the new *Instance* a name, purpose and description, the most important thing is to select the *Product* you want to deploy. Additionally, The initial *product version* has to be chosen. It can be changed later at anytime (_up-_ and _downgrade_).

It is a common requirement that certain *processes* of an *Instance* should be automatically started whenever the *BDeploy* server itself is started. To accomplish that, the _Automatic Startup_ flag of the *Instance* must be set. 

The *Instance* determines whether it is included in the automatic cleanup job. If the option _Automatic Uninstallation_ is enabled, the cleanup job will uninstall all *instance versions* that are older than the activated and the previously activated *instance version*. Due to this automatic uninstallation some of the old *product versions* might become unused. If the option _Automatic Cleanup_ is activated on the instance group, these unused *product versions* are deleted too (see <<_instance_group,Instance Group>>).

Click an *Instance* to proceed to the <<Instance Dashboard>>.
